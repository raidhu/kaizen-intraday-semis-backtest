## 📊 How It Works

### Daily Cycle

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| **9:30 AM** | Records day start equity |
| **Continuous** | Monitors -2% stop loss |
| **3:55 PM** | Enters if BULL signal + no position |
| **4:00 PM** | Updates EMAs, checks bear exit |

### When You Add Money

1. System recalculates at **4:00 PM** (market close)
2. Updates EMAs with today's close price
3. Checks signal: BULL or BEAR
4. If **BULL** → enters position at **3:55 PM next day**
5. Position sized on **new total equity**

### Stop Loss

- Monitors equity every 5 seconds
- If daily loss ≥ **-2%** → exits immediately
- Can **re-enter same day** at 3:55 PM if BULL signal remains

### Leverage Scaling

| VIX Level | Leverage |
|-----------|----------|
| VIX < 12 | 3.75x |
| VIX < 13 | 3.5x |
| VIX < 14 | 3.25x |
| VIX ≥ 14 | 3.0x |

*Note: Paper trading uses default 3.0x (VIX not available)*

## 📝 Logs & Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring

- Errors

### Position Check

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No security definition found"
- **Fix:** Check symbol and exchange (SMH on ARCA)

### "Market data requires subscription"
- **Fix:** System uses delayed data (automatic)
- 15-minute delay is acceptable for end-of-day strategy

### "Cannot convert NaN to integer"
- **Fix:** Updated script handles this automatically
- Waits for valid price before entering

### Position not entering
- Check time (must be 3:55 PM ET in production mode)
- Check signal (EMA 25 must be > EMA 125)
- Check TWS is connected and logged in
